# IdleOn Tools

This is a collection of tools to plan and optimize your progression in IdleOn.

## IdleOn Cooking Planner


    -- Gives list of shortest meal upgrades with costs in ladles (same as IT, but considers your speed increase from meal levels in real time)
    -- Estimates time to max cooking with NMLB, equinox cost redux and ladle production
    -- Customizable account stats so you can see which bonus you are missing and what to increase first to progress faster

This is kinda obsolete because of daily meal levels, I might not keep it updated much longer.
