# idleon-tools

This is a collection of tools for the game IdleOn I make for my own use. They are accessible as github pages at <a href="https://tellurium-monoxide.github.io/idleon-tools/" target="_blank">https://tellurium-monoxide.github.io/idleon-tools/</a>.

## cooking-planner
- Gives list of shortest meal upgrades with costs in ladles (same as IT, but considers your speed increase from meal levels in real time)
- Estimates time to max cooking with NMLB, equinox cost redux and ladle production
- Customizable account stats so you can see which bonus you are missing and what to increase first to progress faster

## talent-book-planner
- Lists talents that are not booked to highest level possible, organized in tiers
- Other features planned

## Future tools
I plan to make tools for the following purposes: 
- Shiny levelling planner
- Construction finisher calculator

Those are probably already covered in some google sheet, but I dislike using these for advanced calculations.

## Contributing
You can contribute by reporting bugs or give suggestions for improvements using Github issues if you want.
